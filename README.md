Ground Penetrating Radar Github

The goal of this project is to create a ground penetrating radar system to serve as a non-destructive method for mapping plant root systems. The system consists of a transmitting and receiving antenna and circuitry for both the transmitter and receiver. The transmitting circuit generates a linear frequency-modulated continuous wave from 2.415- 2.425GHz. The wave is pulsed to avoid interference between the transmitting and receiving antenna. The transmitting antenna passes the generated signal into the ground while the receiving antenna collects the reflected signal. The signal will reflect off materials with different dielectric constants like that of roots and pipes. The received signal will then be sent through an LNA for amplification to balance any loss of gain. The signal is also fed into a frequency mixer to correct any occured frequency shift. Finally, the IF signal is converted into digital data that will be recorded for image processing.
